My Application API through Swagger UI using Grizzly and Jersey.

#To run the application, Go to browser and type localhost:8080/docs/ and you will see Swagger UI having all the apis mentioned in the RESTController.

Note* There is a slash after docs/. So please take care of this else it won't work. If you want to see the whole schema of all the apis of your application, please type http://localhost:8080/swagger.json.

Enjy and Happy coding and sharing as well :-)
